            "description_3": "First, it was determined that a series of components would be created to expand the modular spectrum of the Careers design system. Therefore, the idea of developing card-based interfaces was proposed to meet the need. Visualization models were established, including images, paragraphs, and titles, along with a preview of team members, where the status of this target would change depending on the number of people.",

            "description_2": "The visual intent of the website was to evoke the power the  brand has always had over the competition, while also objectively showcasing the proven technical aspects.
